"# binancebot" 

#Progress has been made with the possibility of operating in backtest mode.
#Progress will be made in being able to create a place where results and strategies can be shared.
#There is a lot to do and many things can still be improved, I need collaborators who want to help improve this project and so that we can all earn, not only coins but experience.
#The bot can run in 3 ways:

  > Online, with cryptocurrencies that we have in our account.

  > Online on Tesnet, we can test the bot without using our funds.

  > Backtest, we can test in a period of time how our chosen strategy works, depending on the chosen period it will be fully processed in a few minutes.

INFORMATION
------------
Pressing Crtl + D will display the menu with options.

  > megatronmod.py It is the main module of the bot, it can be executed as a signal or as another function depending on what you need.

  > megatronmod_functions.py Contains all functions and indicators used by MegratronMod.

  > megatronmod_strategy.py Here the strategy that the bot will use is established.

  > languages_bot.py There are the translations of the bot into Spanish (partially) for now.

  > config.yml There are all the bot configurations.

  > tickers.txt In this file saved the quote cryptocurrencies and the base crypto in the configuration file.

  > The volatile list file will change depending on the day and time of creation, I recommend not using such a large list (this is created from the configuration file) because     it will make the bot slow.

LAST CLARIFICATION
-------------------
I have been carrying out this project for more than 3 years, and although it disappointed more than one, I must say that there is no infallible bot. There is no bot that works as a fixed term, there are great limitations just by using trading indicators since these do not predict the future. Obviously, technology will advance, it will be able to come close, but it will not be infallible either. 

I'm tired, I've been working alone on this project for a long time....
