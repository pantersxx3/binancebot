"# binancebot" 

#Progress has been made with the possibility of operating in backtest mode.
#Progress will be made in being able to create a place where results and strategies can be shared.
#There is a lot to do and many things can still be improved, I need collaborators who want to help improve this project and so that we can all earn, not only coins but experience.
#The bot can run in 3 ways:

  > Online, with cryptocurrencies that we have in our account.

  > Online on Tesnet, we can test the bot without using our funds.

  > Backtest, we can test in a period of time how our chosen strategy works, depending on the chosen period it will be fully processed in a few minutes.
